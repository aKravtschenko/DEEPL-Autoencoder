# Autoencoder zur Anomalieerkennung im Netzwerkdatenverkehr von Gruppe 8 in DEEPL (Autoencoder for anomaly detection within network traffic)
# Contained Notebooks in this repository are:
- **DEEPL_Autoencoder.ipynb** written by Alexej Kravtschenko
   - **Decription:** This notebook contains everything needed for the usage of an autoencoder with super- and unsupervised learning.
   - **Dataset:** The UNSW_NB15_training-set and testing_set.csv datasets were used.
It's not fully automated, therefore some simple manual work will be needed. Every segment is mostly commented with explanations and instructions. 
- **old_main.ipynb** written by Alexej Kravtschenko (outdated)
    - **Dataset:** The UNSW_NB15_training-set and testing_set.csv datasets were used.
- **unsupervised_Autoencoder.ipynb** written by Nathan Dze Kadisoh
    - **Dataset:** UNSW_NB15_training-set, UNSW_NB15_testing_set.csv and creditcard.csv
